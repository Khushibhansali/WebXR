# WebXR

Draws Gabor Representation of Signal to determine the sinusoidal frequency and the associated perceptual performance for user. 

I modified https://github.com/malago86/WebXR-tools by adding a button to have the target show at 9 fixed locations and ensure that the gausssian envelope applies to each position.
